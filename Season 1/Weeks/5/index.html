<h3 id="matthew-gottshallmg2-ur-delver-----sean-ottawayso2-punishing-dack"><a href="/MG2-UR-Delver">Matthew Gottshall</a> ? - ? <a href="/SO2-Punishing-Dack">Sean Ottaway</a></h3>

<p><strong><em>Matthew Gottshall</em></strong>: Game One my Delver pretty much went the distance, then a Pyromancer cleaned up.
Game Two he wasted my turn one Volc putting me behind for a while but he didn’t draw much and I eventually went broken, including stealing a Sapphire and Seat of the Synod from him to Hardcast an Ingot Chewer to beat, Pyromancer also closed out this game as well.</p>

<p>I was actually not looking forward to the match given his list had Grove and Punishing Fire and 4 Sudden Shock in the board.</p>

<h3 id="james-saltsmanjgs2-stax-2---1-stormanimagusst2-california-shops"><a href="/JGS2-Stax">James Saltsman</a> 2 - 1 <a href="/ST2-California-Shops">Stormanimagus</a></h3>

<p><strong><em>James Saltsman</em></strong>: Game 1: I win the die roll and decide to play. My hand comprises of Hellkite, Sol Ring, Golem, Factory, Ruby, Thorn, and another Factory. Storm’s hand consists of Crucible, Chalice, Wurmcoil, Tomb, Emerald, Ravager, and Waste. I decide to keep as does my opponent. I lead with Ruby, Sol Ring, Thorn, play Factory and pass. Storm draws a Buried Ruin and plays it to cast Emerald. Then casts Chalice set to zero. I draw a Tomb and play it on my turn casting Golem and floating a colorless mana to attack with Factory to strike first. Storm draws into another land, a Waste this time. He plays Waste and casts a Ravager and wastes my Tomb. I draw a Forgemaster. I attack with Golem and Storm sacs his Emerald and Chalice to Ravager and we exchange creatures. For the second main phase I play Factor number two and cast my Forgemaster. Storm draws strong with a Revoker naming my Forgemaster while keeping his Tomb in hand. I draw a Revoker of my own for my turn. I decide to Animate my Factories and attack with Forgemaster and Factories and he takes all damage. Storm’s life total is at 11 at this point. He draws a second Revoker and plays Tomb for turn. He casts his Revoker naming my Sol Ring. I draw a Waste for my turn and decide to attack with my Factory and Forgemaster (no blocks from Storm) and pump Factory. I decide to use my Waste on his Tomb and he draws into an unplayable Golem. GG. I lead 1-0.</p>

<p>Game 2: For Game 2, since I am on the draw I board out Chalices, Trinisphere, and Thorns. I bring in post board 3 Crucibles, 1 Duplicant, 1 Wurmcoil, 1 Triselion, 2 Dismembers, and 1 Batterskull. Storms hand is Mana Crypt, Tolarian Academy, Crucible, Wire, Strip, Revoker, and Ruby. My 7 card hand is Golem, Factory, Ruby, Dup, Waste, Factory, and Tomb. Storm keeps and I decide to take a mulligan. My 6 is now Dismember, Ruby, 2 Shops, Tomb, and a Forgemaster and I decide to keep. Storm leads with Crypt, Ruby, and Academy, playing Revoker and naming Lotus, while being able to cast Crucible off Academy for a very strong start. I draw Sundering Titan and play Ruby, Tomb, and pass turn. Storm rolls for Crypt on upkeep and takes his 3 damage. He casts Wire and Portal off Academy and attacks with Revoker bringing me to 18. Storm holds his Strip in hand. I draw into Tomb number two and pass turn. Storm takes another 3 damage from Crypt (18-14 in my favor now). He taps his Cruci, Wire, and Portal to his Wire at 3 fade counters. With card advantage and Cruci out for Storm, my only chance is that is dies to his Crypt this game. Highlight/quote of the match was delivered from Storm: “I HAVE A BILLION WAYS TO SAC ARTIFACTS IN THIS DECK and I draw 2 cards a turn c’mon magic.” His draw off Portal is Waste, but his draw for turn was Smokestack (this is key because he is able to sacrifice his Crypt now). He attacks for 2 with Revoker and casts Smokestack. I continue to play game 2 even though Storm has me in Waste/Crucible lock with Wire/Smoke as well, not to mention his card drawing advantage with Coercive Portal. I got 99 problems but a Karn ain’t one I was thinking to myself. He draws and casts Karn for turn making matters even worse for me. I resign and we go onto the third and deciding game 3. GG. It is now even at 1-1.</p>

<p>Game 3: Since I am on the play I decide to bring back in Chalices. My sideboard for the deciding game/match consists of 3 Cages, 2 Ratchet Bombs, 1 Witchbane Orb, 4 Thorns, 1 Trinisphere, 3 Spheres, and 1 Sundering Titan. I draw solidly with a hand of Crypt, Golem, Pearl, Shop, Revoker, Sol Ring, and Academy. I decide to keep. Storm draws a weak 7 of a pair of Revokers and Golems, a Smokestack, Jet, and a Wurm. Storm mulls to 6. His 6 is much better with Academy, Emerald, Sol Ring, Ravager, Revoker, and Buried Ruin. He keeps. I lead with Pearl casting Sol Ring and play Shop/land for turn thereby playing Golem. I decide to keep Crypt in hand being that I have an Academy in hand and pass the turn. Storm draws a Waste and Wastes my Shop. He continues to play Emerald for Sol Ring and casting Revoker naming my Pearl. I draw a Tomb and attack with Golem, no blocks. I cast my Revoker during second main phase and name Sol Ring and play Tomb. Storm draws Portal for his turn. Storm plays Academy and casts Portal ending the turn. I draw a Triskelion for my turn. I play Academy and cast Trisk thereby destroying his Revoker and attack with Revoker and Golem with no creatures on his field. Life totals are currently 18 to 8 in my favor. He draws Wire off Portal and Waste for turn. Storm plays Waste/land for turn and is able to cast Wire and Ravager for his turn. I tap down Sol Ring, Pearl, Tomb, and Trisk for Storm’s Wire. I draw and cast Black Lotus. I attack with my my Revoker and Golem and before Storm blocks he sacrifices Sol Ring and Wire thereby making his Ravager a 3/3 and blocks my Golem. He is now at 6 life with zero creatures on board. He draws Ghost Quarter from Portal and a second Portal for his draw for turn. He play Buried Ruin and sacs it for Revoker and plays Revoker naming my Trisk. I draw a Factory for turn. I alpha strike with Revoker and Trisk. He chump blocks my Revoker and he goes to 3 life. I play Factory/land for turn. Storm draw a Wurm off Portal and a Razormane Masticore for draw for turn. He plays Quarter and taps out to play Razormane and ends the turn. Regardless of what I draw it is game at this point. I do draw a Waste though for the record. I remove a Trisk counter bringing Storm to 2 life and animate and attack with a 2/2 Trisk and Factory for the win.</p>

<p>In sum, winning the die roll and being able to go first game 1 is an advantage in the mirror MU. Also, deciding to board in a second Trisk got me there. GGs Noah!</p>
