### This concludes the Swiss Rounds of Season One of The Mana Drain Vintage League, we have had some interesting decks, some innovation, some amazing plays, some disappointments but now we move to the next stage: playoffs!

Here are the final standings after the Swiss Rounds:


- 1. Brian Kelly (8-1)
- 2. Dave Kaplan (5-4) (3)
- 3. Matthew Gottshall (5-4) (1)
- 4. James Saltsman (5-4) (0)
- 5. White Lotus (5-4) (-2)
- 6. Stormanimagus (4-5)
- 7. Tom Dixon (4-5)
- 8. Sean Ottaway (4-5)
- 9. Wappla (3-6)
- 10. MaximumCDawg (2-7)

Game wins will serve as tie breakers due to time constraints, as we had 4 players tied at 5-4 but only three can make qualify playoffs. MaximumCDawg, having gotten last place, will not be joining us for Season Two, but congratulations to the 9 who get to continue on and a big congrats to the Top 4!

Playoffs will start on Sunday July 12th, will be best of 5 matches with 3 decks of the players choice. The first round of playoffs is Matthew Gottshall (3 seed) vs James Saltsman (4 seed) where higher seed has choice of play. The winner of this round plays David Kaplan (2 seed) on July 19th and then the winner of that plays Brian Kelly (1 seed) on July 26th.

Tune in Next Sunday and watch the first round of playoffs!
