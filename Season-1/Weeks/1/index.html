  <h1>Week 1</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <h3 id="brian-kellybk1-dragonlord-mentor-control-2---0-maximumcdawgmcd1-dark-times"><a href="/BK1-Dragonlord-Mentor-Control">Brian Kelly</a> 2 - 0 <a href="/MCD1-Dark-Times">MaximumCDawg</a></h3>

<p><strong><em>Brian Kelly</em></strong>: Game 1, MaximumCDawg was devoured by the venerable Dragonlord Ojutai himself who survived a sorcery speed assassination attempt and then Pondered into Time Walk.  The Dragonlord was particularly offended by this comment dated March 7, 2015:</p>

<p><em>Quote from: MaximumCDawg</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a bad card.  I can see someone getting a spark in their eyes when they see a big dumb blue flyer that is better than Air Elemental and SEEMS like it has protection and a card advantage ability.</p>

  <p>But beauty’s only skin deep.  A big dumb beater must do some very specific things to be Vintage playable.  What this card does is NOT that.
It dodges Sorcery speed removal.  We don’t play any.  It mini-impulses when it hits the player.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The full extent of Ojutai’s fury was revealed Game 2 when Dack Fayden ultimated into an emblem that enabled Fire//Ice to steal Marit Lage forever.  Unfortunately, he did not have a chance to swing because MCD died to his own Mana Crypt.  Ojutai was pleased.</p>

<p>No Notes</p>

<p><strong><em>Dave Kaplan</em></strong>: Very key Strip Mine to take out wappla’s only land G2.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="sean-ottawayso1-oath-2---1-tom-dixontd1-landstill"><a href="/SO1-Oath">Sean Ottaway</a> 2 - 1 <a href="/TD1-Landstill">Tom Dixon</a></h3>

<p><strong><em>Tom Dixon</em></strong>: Lost in 3. G1 He had t2 Show and Tell under my Mindbreak Trap. G2 I had Standstills. G3 He had t1 Mox Orchard Oath for my LoA 2x Priest and Mindbreak Trap. Pretty strong hands from him. Look forward to next week.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sean Ottaway</em></strong>: I had a couple of great opening hands in the right spots.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="white-lotuswl1-jeskai-gush-control-2---1-stormanimagusst1-stone-cold-humans"><a href="/WL1-Jeskai-Gush-Control">White Lotus</a> 2 - 1 <a href="/ST1-Stone-Cold-Humans">Stormanimagus</a></h3>

<p><strong><em>White Lotus</em></strong>:
I manage to win 2 sideboarded games after getting blown out of my mind G1 Storm 1-2 WLotus.</p>

<p>I lose G1 quickly to cavern into Thalia, Bob and Knight with double Force of Will and Mana Drain in hand.</p>

<p>Board out most of my situationnal counters and bring in removal.</p>

<p>G2 he isnt able to maintain pressure outside of dr shaman so Gushes digs and dack +1 activations get there.</p>

<p>G3 I gush into Jace turn two and overwhelm him with card advantage removal and a second copy of mentor to finish the job after I misplayed by running the first one into abrupt decay with no monk tokens.</p>

<p>Fun note: I ended up playing ponder on turn one every single game.</p>
