  <h1>Week 7</h1>

<h3 id="maximumcdawg-1---2-stormanimagus">MaximumCDawg 1 - 2 Stormanimagus</h3>

<p><strong><em>MaximumCDawg</em></strong>: The match against Stormy was a boondoggle.  My internet connection kept burping and we’d lose the entire game.  He was nice enough to reset once we did that, but even so, I was doing really well Game 1 before the bad times struck.  The games did not feel terribly lopsided, but he managed to keep the control roll up just enough before finally Mentorin’ for the win</p>

<h3 id="james-saltsman--0---2-sean-ottaway">James Saltsman  0 - 2 Sean Ottaway</h3>

<p><strong><em>Sean Ottaway</em></strong>: Game one he gets a solid start with some Thorns and Revoker on Time Vault (which I have in play). I have a Welder but haven’t found anything to Weld on either side. I steal his Revoker with Dack, he copies Revoker naming Dack, has a couple more lock pieces and finds a Golem. I’m eventually able to get a revoker into his graveyard to take care of the Null Rod in play, which gives me the mana I need to Hurkyl’s him. Put the game away shortly after, tutoring for Key and Welding the Vault back in.</p>

<p>Game two we both mulligan, he has a mana light hand (wasteland and Factory) and a Chalice on 0. I have a turn 1 Welder. I Chewer his Chalice, he attacks with Factory, I weld the Chalice back into play, cast a vault and tutor up key for the win.</p>

<p>Not a great matchup for James, 4 maindeck welders and Dacks makes life difficult for a workshop, but good games regardless!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="wappla-2---0-white-lotus">Wappla 2 - 0 White Lotus</h3>

<p><strong><em>WhiteLotus</em></strong>: G1 I choose to play conservatively rather than take a risky opening knowing that I probed him t1 and his hand was pretty bad, but his topdecks help him a lot, while mine don’t change anything so my line ends up costing me the game.</p>

<p>G2 just an insane amount of variance in his direction, nothing I can do my opponent has it all and my draws are pretty awful.</p>
