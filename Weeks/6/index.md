### [Tom Dixon](/TD2-Dredge) 2 - 0 [James Saltsman](/JGS2-Stax)

***Tom Dixon***: G1: I had Bazaar on 7, with Dredgers and Bridge. He wasted me but I was able to get to 8 a few times and eventually Ichorid and Bloodghast made enough Zombies to eat his brains.

G2: I keep a no Bazaar hand with Powder because it has Chewer 2 Claim Narco and 2 lands as well. He has no hate and only Thorns. I cast Narco to bring the beats and later draw Bazaar. From there, it's academic as my Chewer ate his Forgemaster and then another found his Chalice 1 which freed my Claim's. He also had Crypt as his mana source which really put him away.
