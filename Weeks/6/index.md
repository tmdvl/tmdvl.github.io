### [MaximumCDawg](/MCD2-The-White-Gate) 0 - 2 [Dave Kaplan](/DK2-UR-Delver)

***MaximumCDawg***: First match, I keep a hand with two Bobs and a Stoneforge.  I figure that I'll jam 2cc dorks until one sticks, end with the Stoneforge, and try to ride that out.  We trade discard and countermagic and then I resolve Bob.  I miss Bob's first trigger and then he eats a bolt, so Bob didn't accomplish much.  Eventually Stoneforge and Batterskull do arrive, but in the three turns it takes to get that far a Pyromancer has been giving birth for a few turns and he has been digging up a storm.  Dack arrives to deal with Batterskull and a second Pyromancer makes things totally ridiculous.

SB: I bring in the Illness in the Ranks.

Second match, I fan to a hand with only a Plains for mana.  That's not gonna do it.  So I fan to six with NO mana.  Then fan to five, see a Wasteland as only mana.  Finally, I fan to four and find a swamp, nighthawk, Illness, and Inquisition.  I lead with Swamp->Inquire and it eats a Misstep.  Perfect.  I then resolve Illness, and hope that shutting off Pyromancer will give me time to play with.  He resolves a Delver but it can't flip, and eventually gets killed by Innocent Blood.  Then, opponent starts playing Pyros as grizzly bears, which is just fine because I'm stuck on 2 lands. By the time I finally get to cast Nighthawk, it's just too late.

### [Tom Dixon](/TD2-Dredge) 2 - 0 [James Saltsman](/JGS2-Stax)

***Tom Dixon***: G1: I had Bazaar on 7, with Dredgers and Bridge. He wasted me but I was able to get to 8 a few times and eventually Ichorid and Bloodghast made enough Zombies to eat his brains.

G2: I keep a no Bazaar hand with Powder because it has Chewer 2 Claim Narco and 2 lands as well. He has no hate and only Thorns. I cast Narco to bring the beats and later draw Bazaar. From there, it's academic as my Chewer ate his Forgemaster and then another found his Chalice 1 which freed my Claim's. He also had Crypt as his mana source which really put him away.

***White Lotus***: Defense grids/Abeyances get there after being countered and tutored up multiple times.
G1 on the back of tezzeret -2 fetch Time vault + untap with Mind over Matter.
G2 I stroke myself for 27 (the rest of my deck), untap Candelabra (which untaps Academy and Minamo, minamo untaps Academy) a bunch of times with Mind over matter and stroke my opponent with over 900 blue mana in pool.
