### [MaximumCDawg](/MCD3-Chain-Combo) 2 - 0 [Sean Ottaway](/SO3-Thanks-Artifacts)

***MaximumCDawg***: I got the better of SeanOhh in two, and I think that the games basically came down to the facts that almost all of my cards are live in that matchup and that he topdecked like a skunk.  I was anticipating a lot of workshop and dredge, since I figured people would want to shore up the last few rounds, so I was packing lots of artifact and shop hate.  That worked out alright, and I the limited amount of cards I drew compared to his deck was enough to win given his dead draws.
