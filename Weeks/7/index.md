### MaximumCDawg 1 - 2 Stormanimagus

***MaximumCDawg***: The match against Stormy was a boondoggle.  My internet connection kept burping and we'd lose the entire game.  He was nice enough to reset once we did that, but even so, I was doing really well Game 1 before the bad times struck.  The games did not feel terribly lopsided, but he managed to keep the control roll up just enough before finally Mentorin' for the win

### James Saltsman  0 - 2 Sean Ottaway

***Sean Ottaway***: Game one he gets a solid start with some Thorns and Revoker on Time Vault (which I have in play). I have a Welder but haven't found anything to Weld on either side. I steal his Revoker with Dack, he copies Revoker naming Dack, has a couple more lock pieces and finds a Golem. I'm eventually able to get a revoker into his graveyard to take care of the Null Rod in play, which gives me the mana I need to Hurkyl's him. Put the game away shortly after, tutoring for Key and Welding the Vault back in.

Game two we both mulligan, he has a mana light hand (wasteland and Factory) and a Chalice on 0. I have a turn 1 Welder. I Chewer his Chalice, he attacks with Factory, I weld the Chalice back into play, cast a vault and tutor up key for the win.

Not a great matchup for James, 4 maindeck welders and Dacks makes life difficult for a workshop, but good games regardless!

### Wappla 2 - 0 White Lotus

***WhiteLotus***: G1 I choose to play conservatively rather than take a risky opening knowing that I probed him t1 and his hand was pretty bad, but his topdecks help him a lot, while mine don't change anything so my line ends up costing me the game.

G2 just an insane amount of variance in his direction, nothing I can do my opponent has it all and my draws are pretty awful.
