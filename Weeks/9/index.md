### [Sean Ottaway](/SO3-Thanks-Artifacts) 0 - 2 [Stormanimagus](/ST3-Mentor)

***Stormanimagus***: Game 1 was just very awkward for both of us. Mana Crypt did it's usual job of halving my opponent's life total and Mentor did the rest despite me drawing 1 land in 18 cards (2 moxen for the mentor) and sitting on a dig and a dack the whole game that would have been castable if I drew 1 land. He really whiffed on red land early which bought me the tempo and time I needed to get there. Awkward awkward game for both of us.

Game 2 was a little more interesting at first but it spiraled out of control late. I opened on double misstep double plow and only 1 misstep ended up being useful to eat an early Goblin Welder. Early Stony Silence kept his mana at bay but then he gets dack and starts ripping through his deck while I topdeck. . . nothing. This goes on for many turns. A Daretti and Tezz eventually join the party on his end, but he still doesn't have an out to the stony and he can't seem to find a Wurmcoil to bin. After using an Ancestral to find Mentor I finally have a threat to start chipping away at his life total and he's down to 0 cards in hand at the beginning of each turn. I steal a mox of his with a Dack of my own to reduce the value of his Tolarian and simultaneously make Tezz's ultimate way worse. It's an insane game where he has 3 plainswalkers in play for much of the end of the game just chugging away and finding him nothing relevant in the face of an active Stony Silence. My Mentor eventually delivers the goods with a turn of spell chaining and gross prowessing. Weird note. I did not cast a single Gush or even see a Gush either game. crazy!

### [Tom Dixon](/TD3-Martello-Shops) 1 - 2 [Wappla](/W3-Terra-Nova)

***Wappla***: Game 1: Tom wins the roll and opens with Chalice 0 and Sphere. Although I have a Workshop and two Golems, Sphere keeps me off them. The only spell I resolve this game is a lone Revoker.

Game 2: On the play, I lead with Null Rod. He has a early Golem, but I Ghost Quarter his Shop, take a hit, then Metamorph his Golem. He doesn't draw another land until my board is overwhelming.

Game 3: My opening hand is Ruby, Factory, Factory, Factory, Mutavault, Ancient Tomb, Dismember. I'm inexperienced in the mirror, but on the draw, this hand seems legitimately great. Tom opens with a interesting Chalice @ 2, shutting off Null Rod and Revoker. I draw into two copy spells. Tom has to burn his Metamorph on his Factory to keep up with my eventual five manlands. I draw into Batterskull, casting it and copying it with Steel. Tom's card in hand is a Duplicant and his board is full of mana and nothing to do with it.

### [Matthew Gottshall](/MG3-Crime-City-Vault) 2 - 1 [Dave Kaplan](/DK3-Frobots)

***Matthew Gottshall***: I lost Game one fairly easily since that's what storm decks generally do against shops, especially when they lose the die roll (1 to his 14).
Game two I play a bunch of stuff turn one including a Dack set up turn two Vault Key.
Game Three was close but I Pondered into a Hurkyls that I used at his end phase to comeback and hardcast Sphinx of the Steel Wind for the Win! I had many spectators watching so they can share anything I didn't.

### [James Saltsman](/JGS3-Terra-Nova) 2 - 0 [MaximumCDawg](/MCD3-Chain-Combo)

***James Saltsman***: Max wins the die roll, but mulls to 4 and concedes after I resolve a Chalice at 1 and have a Sphere, Thorn, and Mutavault on field by turn 2. Game 2 is even more unfortunate for Max since he kept losing connection and decided to concede to me.

### [Brian Kelly](/BK3-Armored-Dragon) 2 - 0 [White Lotus](/WL3-Burning-Oath)

Game 1 he mulled to Turn 1 Defense Grid with Preordain, Dark Ritual (no outlet), and Oath of Druids with no Orchard.  I countered everything except Oath of Druids and used Jace to fateseal several Orchards to the bottom.  The last straw was when I paid 5 through Grid to use the Spell Pierce mode of Izzet Charm on his Dark Ritual.

Game 2, he died to 3 Spirit tokens, 1 Containment Priest, 1 Ethersworn Canonist, and 2 Force of Wills.
