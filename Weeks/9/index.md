### [Sean Ottaway](/SO3-Thanks-Artifacts) ? - ? [Stormanimagus](/ST3-Mentor)

<br />

### [Tom Dixon](/TD3-Martello-Shops) 1 - 2 [Wappla](/W3-Terra-Nova)

***Wappla***: Game 1: Tom wins the roll and opens with Chalice 0 and Sphere. Although I have a Workshop and two Golems, Sphere keeps me off them. The only spell I resolve this game is a lone Revoker.

Game 2: On the play, I lead with Null Rod. He has a early Golem, but I Ghost Quarter his Shop, take a hit, then Metamorph his Golem. He doesn't draw another land until my board is overwhelming.

Game 3: My opening hand is Ruby, Factory, Factory, Factory, Mutavault, Ancient Tomb, Dismember. I'm inexperienced in the mirror, but on the draw, this hand seems legitimately great. Tom opens with a interesting Chalice @ 2, shutting off Null Rod and Revoker. I draw into two copy spells. Tom has to burn his Metamorph on his Factory to keep up with my eventual five manlands. I draw into Batterskull, casting it and copying it with Steel. Tom's card in hand is a Duplicant and his board is full of mana and nothing to do with it.

### [Matthew Gottshall](/MG3-Crime-City-Vault) 2 - 1 [Dave Kaplan](/DK3-Frobots)

***Matthew Gottshall***: I lost Game one fairly easily since that's what storm decks generally do against shops, especially when they lose the die roll (1 to his 14).
Game two I play a bunch of stuff turn one including a Dack set up turn two Vault Key.
Game Three was close but I Pondered into a Hurkyls that I used at his end phase to comeback and hardcast Sphinx of the Steel Wind for the Win! I had many spectators watching so they can share anything I didn't.
